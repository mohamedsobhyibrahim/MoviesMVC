# MoviesMVC
Very Simple App to know the consept of MVC

# MVC Pattern

Models: Models contain the displayed data. Usually, this data is fetched from the network or a local database. Then the data is put into small, simple classes which the other components can use.

Views: Views are what’s displayed to the user. They also handle any interaction a user may have with the screen — click listeners, for example. A view should only be responsible for displaying things and should not contain any business logic. As such, the view tends to be a lightweight component compared to a controller and typically doesn’t contain much code. In Android, the view responsibility often falls onto activities and fragments.

Controllers: Controllers are a way to connect models and views together. The controller updates the model when something happens in the view. The controller will also update the view when the model changes. Too often, the controller responsibilities are also found in activities and fragments.
