# MoviesMVC
Very Simple App to know the consept of MVC

# MVC Pattern

Model: contains application data and business logic (the rules of the system). For example, user accounts, products you sell, a set of photos, etc. The model component has no knowledge of the interface.

View: contains everything that is visible on the screen and offers interaction to the user. For example, (activity_main.xml)

Controller: This is the "glue" between the view and the model, which also manages the application logic. The controller reacts to the user's input and presents the data requested by the user. Where does it retrieve the data from? Yes, you guessed it: the model.
